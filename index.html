      <p>If I were to pick one favourite hobby of mine out of the many I have, I will definitely pick video gaming. I developed a taste for gamming when I was very young.  I was pro at Driving. 

I have always had a love for music and chess. However, I never realized the utter joy they bring to humans. chess gives us a lot of brain exercises. This kind of brain exercise is extremely delightful and enjoyable.

Moreover, video game also taught me how to stay strong and push my limits. In fact, it pushes me to do my best and realize my potential more than ever.
